# Love4Detailing Production Stress Test & Real-World Simulation Guide

## üéØ Test Objectives

1. **Stress Test**: Simulate high-volume booking scenarios
2. **Real-World Test**: Create a week's worth of realistic bookings
3. **Bug Identification**: Find and fix button/navigation issues
4. **Data Consistency**: Verify dynamic data updates across all views

## üìã Test Plan

### Phase 1: Stress Test (High Volume)

```
TEST SCENARIO: Monday Morning Rush

STEPS:
1. Open 5 browser tabs on Vercel deployment
2. Attempt to book same time slots simultaneously
3. Verify only one booking succeeds per slot
4. Check if booking locks work (15-minute reservation)
5. Monitor for any 500 errors or timeouts
```

If critical bugs found during testing:

```typescript
// Quick fix template for common issues:

// 1. Missing onClick handler
<Button onClick={() => router.push('/target-page')}>

// 2. Data not updating
const { data, refetch } = useQuery()
// Add after mutation:
await refetch()

// 3. Form submission failing
onSubmit={async (data) => {
  try {
    setLoading(true)
    await submitForm(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Submission error:', error)
    toast.error('Failed to submit')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}}

// 4. Navigation not working
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation' // not 'next/router'

// 5. Data refresh issues
router.refresh() // Force refresh server components
```
