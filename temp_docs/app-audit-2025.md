## 💾 Database Schema

### Ultra-Flexible Scheduling System Architecture (Enhanced Jan 2025)
The application implements a sophisticated multi-layer scheduling system with **15-minute precision**:

```sql
weekly_schedule_template     # Base recurring schedule patterns (NEW: 5 custom time slots)
├── slot_1_time             # Custom time for slot 1 (e.g., 8:15 AM)
├── slot_2_time             # Custom time for slot 2 (e.g., 10:45 AM)  
├── slot_3_time             # Custom time for slot 3 (e.g., 1:30 PM)
├── slot_4_time             # Custom time for slot 4 (e.g., 3:15 PM)
└── slot_5_time             # Custom time for slot 5 (e.g., 6:45 PM)
         ↓
daily_availability          # Day-specific availability overrides  
         ↓
time_slots                  # Individual bookable time slots (UPDATED: is_available)
         ↓
calendar_availability_view  # Computed real-time availability
         ↓
booking_locks              # Temporary 15-minute reservations
         ↓
bookings                   # Confirmed appointments
```

This **Ultra-Flexible** approach enables:
- **15-Minute Precision**: 288 possible appointment times per day (8:00 AM - 8:00 PM)
- **Custom Daily Schedules**: Different times for each day of the week
- **Lifestyle Adaptation**: Early birds (8:15 AM), lunch specials (1:30 PM), evening service (7:45 PM)
- **Business Optimization**: Align appointment times with personal schedule and business operations
- **Visual Booking Experience**: Customers see exact preferred appointment times
- **Admin Flexibility**: Real-time schedule adjustments with 15-minute granularity

### Complete Table Structure
```sql
-- Core User & Authentication
users (auth, roles, profile data)
  ↓ one-to-many
vehicles (registration, size, photos, user data)
  ↓ many-to-one  
vehicle_sizes (pricing, categories)

-- Booking & Scheduling System
time_slots (availability, scheduling)
daily_availability (day-specific availability)
weekly_schedule_template (recurring schedule patterns)
calendar_availability_view (computed availability view)
  ↓ one-to-one
booking_locks (15-min reservations during checkout)
  ↓ one-to-many
bookings (customer, vehicle, payment, status)

-- Rewards & Loyalty System
rewards (tier definitions, benefits)
loyalty_points (user point balances)
reward_transactions (point earning/spending history)

-- Administrative & Tracking
admin_notes (booking annotations, internal notes)
missing_vehicle_models (unmatched vehicle tracking)
unmatched_vehicles (vehicles without size mapping)

-- System Management
rate_limits (API rate limiting configuration)
```

### Advanced Database Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables protected with role-based access
- **Booking Locks**: Prevent double-booking during checkout process
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Multi-layer availability system with daily/weekly templates
- **Calendar Views**: Computed availability views for efficient querying
- **Vehicle Intelligence**: Automatic size categorization with fallback tracking
- **Loyalty System**: Separated points balance and transaction history
- **Rate Limiting**: Database-level API rate limiting configuration
- **Audit Trails**: created_at, updated_at timestamps on all relevant tables
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Scalable, secure identifiers across all tables
- **Unique Constraints**: Business rule enforcement and data integrity

## 🎯 Core Features & Business Logic

### 1. Smart Vehicle Management
```typescript
Features:
✅ 106,000+ vehicle size database
✅ Automatic size detection from registration
✅ Manual override capability
✅ Photo upload and storage
✅ Unmatched vehicle tracking
✅ Dynamic pricing by size

Business Rules:
- Small: £55, Medium: £60, Large: £65, XLarge: £70

- Vehicle photos stored securely in Supabase storage
- Fallback to manual size selection when auto-detection fails
```

### 2. Multi-Step Booking System
```typescript
Booking Flow (5 Steps):
1. Vehicle Selection/Registration
2. Personal Details (anonymous → account creation)
3. Vehicle Size Confirmation
4. Date & Time Selection
5. Booking Summary & Confirmation

Advanced Features:
✅ Anonymous user booking (account created during flow)
✅ 15-minute time slot locks
✅ Real-time availability checking
✅ Booking reference generation
✅ Email confirmations
✅ Payment integration (cash only, Stripe disabled)
```

### 3. Three-Tier Rewards System
```typescript
Tier Structure:
Bronze (0-499 points):   Full Valet
Silver (500-999 points): 10% discount + priority booking  
Gold (1000+ points):     15% discount + VIP treatment

Points System:
- 100 points per completed booking
- 250 points per referral
- Points expire after 12 months
- Automatic tier progression
```

### 4. Comprehensive Admin Dashboard
```typescript
Admin Capabilities:
✅ Revenue & booking analytics
✅ Customer management (view, edit, role assignment)
✅ Booking management (create, edit, cancel, notes)
✅ Time slot generation & availability management
✅ Unmatched vehicle review
✅ Rewards system oversight
✅ User role management (Customer ↔ Admin)
```

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### Authentication System
```typescript
Provider: Supabase Auth
Roles: Public, Customer, Admin
Protection: Middleware-based route protection
Sessions: Automatic refresh, persistent login
Anonymous: Secure account creation during booking
```

### Security Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Role-based Access**: Three distinct permission levels
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js security
- **Secure File Upload**: Supabase storage with RLS
- **Environment Security**: Sensitive keys properly managed

### Route Protection
```typescript
Public Routes:     /, /book, /confirmation
Customer Routes:   /dashboard/*, /profile, /rewards  
Admin Routes:      /admin/*
Auth Routes:       /auth/* (redirect if authenticated)
```
