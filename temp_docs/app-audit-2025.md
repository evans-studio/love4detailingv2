## 💾 Database Schema

### Complete Table Structure
```sql
-- Core User & Authentication
users (auth, roles, profile data)
  ↓ one-to-many
vehicles (registration, size, photos, DVLA data)
  ↓ many-to-one  
vehicle_sizes (pricing, categories)

-- Booking & Scheduling System
time_slots (availability, scheduling)
daily_availability (day-specific availability)
weekly_schedule_template (recurring schedule patterns)
calendar_availability_view (computed availability view)
  ↓ one-to-one
booking_locks (15-min reservations during checkout)
  ↓ one-to-many
bookings (customer, vehicle, payment, status)

-- Rewards & Loyalty System
rewards (tier definitions, benefits)
loyalty_points (user point balances)
reward_transactions (point earning/spending history)

-- Administrative & Tracking
admin_notes (booking annotations, internal notes)
missing_vehicle_models (unmatched DVLA lookup tracking)
unmatched_vehicles (vehicles without size mapping)

-- System Management
rate_limits (API rate limiting configuration)
```

### Scheduling System Architecture
The application implements a sophisticated multi-layer scheduling system:

```sql
weekly_schedule_template     # Base recurring schedule patterns
         ↓
daily_availability          # Day-specific availability overrides  
         ↓
time_slots                  # Individual bookable time slots
         ↓
calendar_availability_view  # Computed real-time availability
         ↓
booking_locks              # Temporary 15-minute reservations
         ↓
bookings                   # Confirmed appointments
```

This layered approach allows for:
- **Template Scheduling**: Set recurring weekly patterns
- **Override Capability**: Modify specific days (holidays, staff changes)
- **Real-time Availability**: Computed views for fast availability checks
- **Booking Protection**: Lock system prevents race conditions
- **Flexible Management**: Admin can adjust availability at multiple levels
```sql
-- Core User & Authentication
users (auth, roles, profile data)
  ↓ one-to-many
vehicles (registration, size, photos, DVLA data)
  ↓ many-to-one  
vehicle_sizes (pricing, categories)

-- Booking & Scheduling System
time_slots (availability, scheduling)
daily_availability (day-specific availability)
weekly_schedule_template (recurring schedule patterns)
calendar_availability_view (computed availability view)
  ↓ one-to-one
booking_locks (15-min reservations during checkout)
  ↓ one-to-many
bookings (customer, vehicle, payment, status)

-- Rewards & Loyalty System
rewards (tier definitions, benefits)
loyalty_points (user point balances)
reward_transactions (point earning/spending history)

-- Administrative & Tracking
admin_notes (booking annotations, internal notes)
missing_vehicle_models (unmatched DVLA lookup tracking)
unmatched_vehicles (vehicles without size mapping)

-- System Management
rate_limits (API rate limiting configuration)
```
