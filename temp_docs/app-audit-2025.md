## 💾 Database Schema

### Ultra-Flexible Scheduling System Architecture (Enhanced Jan 2025)
The application implements a sophisticated multi-layer scheduling system with **15-minute precision**:

```sql
weekly_schedule_template     # Base recurring schedule patterns (NEW: 5 custom time slots)
├── slot_1_time             # Custom time for slot 1 (e.g., 8:15 AM)
├── slot_2_time             # Custom time for slot 2 (e.g., 10:45 AM)  
├── slot_3_time             # Custom time for slot 3 (e.g., 1:30 PM)
├── slot_4_time             # Custom time for slot 4 (e.g., 3:15 PM)
└── slot_5_time             # Custom time for slot 5 (e.g., 6:45 PM)
         ↓
daily_availability          # Day-specific availability overrides  
         ↓
time_slots                  # Individual bookable time slots (UPDATED: is_available)
         ↓
calendar_availability_view  # Computed real-time availability
         ↓
booking_locks              # Temporary 15-minute reservations
         ↓
bookings                   # Confirmed appointments
```

This **Ultra-Flexible** approach enables:
- **15-Minute Precision**: 288 possible appointment times per day (8:00 AM - 8:00 PM)
- **Custom Daily Schedules**: Different times for each day of the week
- **Lifestyle Adaptation**: Early birds (8:15 AM), lunch specials (1:30 PM), evening service (7:45 PM)
- **Business Optimization**: Align appointment times with personal schedule and business operations
- **Visual Booking Experience**: Customers see exact preferred appointment times
- **Admin Flexibility**: Real-time schedule adjustments with 15-minute granularity

### Complete Table Structure
```sql
-- Core User & Authentication
users (auth, roles, profile data)
  ↓ one-to-many
vehicles (registration, size, photos, user data)
  ↓ many-to-one  
vehicle_sizes (pricing, categories)

-- Booking & Scheduling System
time_slots (availability, scheduling)
daily_availability (day-specific availability)
weekly_schedule_template (recurring schedule patterns)
calendar_availability_view (computed availability view)
  ↓ one-to-one
booking_locks (15-min reservations during checkout)
  ↓ one-to-many
bookings (customer, vehicle, payment, status)

-- Administrative & Tracking
admin_notes (booking annotations, internal notes)
missing_vehicle_models (unmatched vehicle tracking)
unmatched_vehicles (vehicles without size mapping)

-- System Management
rate_limits (API rate limiting configuration)
```

### Advanced Database Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables protected with role-based access
- **Booking Locks**: Prevent double-booking during checkout process
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Multi-layer availability system with daily/weekly templates
- **Calendar Views**: Computed availability views for efficient querying
