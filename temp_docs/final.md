Complete Customer Data Pre-loading in Booking Forms
Customer Profile Pre-loading Issue: Booking forms not pre-populating authenticated customer's personal details (name, email, phone, address) from their account profile.
Current Problem: All authenticated customers must manually re-enter their personal information during booking process despite having complete profile data stored in their account.
Required Fix: All booking forms must query authenticated user's complete profile from database and pre-populate all personal information fields.
Expected Behavior: When any authenticated customer accesses booking form, all personal details should be automatically filled from their account profile.
Vehicle Integration in Booking Forms
Vehicle Pre-loading Issue: Customer booking forms not displaying authenticated user's existing vehicles for selection during booking process.
Current Problem: Customer successfully adds vehicle to account, vehicle appears in "My Vehicles" page, but booking form does not show available vehicles for selection.
Required Fix: All booking forms (both new booking and "Book Again") must query authenticated user's vehicles from database and present them as selection options.
Expected Behavior: When authenticated customer accesses booking form, all their registered vehicles should be available for selection with pre-filled vehicle details.
Universal Customer Data Integration
Complete Pre-population Requirements: Every authenticated customer account must have all personal and vehicle data automatically loaded into booking forms regardless of booking history.
Customer Profile Data Integration:

Full name from user profile
Email address from account
Phone number from profile
Complete address information (street, city, postcode)
Any saved preferences or notes

Vehicle Data Integration:

All customer's registered vehicles available for selection
Vehicle details (make, model, year, color, registration) auto-populated when selected
Vehicle size and pricing automatically calculated
Option to add new vehicle during booking if needed

Form Modification Capability: Pre-filled data must be editable allowing customers to update information during booking process if details have changed.
Customer Account Data Synchronization
Real-Time Profile Integration: Booking forms must use most current customer profile data ensuring any recent profile updates are reflected in booking forms.
Cross-Account Consistency: All customer accounts regardless of booking history, membership status, or registration date must have identical pre-loading functionality.
Data Validation: Pre-populated customer data must be validated for completeness and accuracy before allowing booking submission.
Profile Update Integration: Any customer information changes during booking process should optionally update customer profile for future bookings.
Customer Vehicle-Booking Integration
Vehicle Selection Workflow: Booking forms must dynamically load customer's vehicle list from database and allow selection with automatic detail population.
Vehicle Detail Auto-population: When customer selects existing vehicle during booking, all vehicle specifications should automatically populate in booking form.
New Vehicle Option: Booking forms should provide option to add new vehicle during booking process if customer wants to book service for unregistered vehicle.
Vehicle Database Relationship: Ensure proper database relationships between customer accounts, vehicle records, and booking creation maintain data integrity.
Customer Dashboard Interface Cleanup
Remove Incorrect Booking Flow Components
"Ready for Your First Booking" Widget Removal: Remove dashboard component that directs existing customers to homepage booking form instead of proper "Book Again" interface.
Current Problem: Dashboard widget button takes authenticated customers to new customer booking form requiring manual entry of all details instead of using pre-filled customer information.
Required Fix: Remove this widget entirely from customer dashboard as authenticated customers should only access "Book Again" workflow with pre-populated data.
Booking Flow Correction
Authenticated Customer Booking Path: Ensure all customer dashboard booking actions direct to "Book Again" interface with pre-filled customer details, vehicle information, and service preferences.
Homepage Booking Form Restriction: Homepage booking form should only be accessible to non-authenticated users for new customer acquisition.
Auto-fill Data Integration: "Book Again" form must pre-populate customer name, contact information, address, and vehicle details with ability to modify location or service preferences as needed.
Booking Flow Separation: Maintain clear separation between new customer booking workflow (homepage) and returning customer booking workflow (dashboard "Book Again").
Dashboard Navigation Cleanup
Remove Conflicting Navigation: Eliminate any dashboard links or buttons that direct authenticated customers to new customer booking processes.
Streamline Customer Actions: Ensure all customer dashboard actions are appropriate for authenticated users with existing account data.
Consistent User Experience: All customer dashboard components should assume user authentication and pre-existing customer data.

üßπ COMPLETE MOCK DATA ELIMINATION REQUIREMENTS
Codebase-Wide Mock Data Audit
Objective: Remove all mock data from entire codebase ensuring platform operates exclusively on real Supabase database data.
Current Problem: Platform components still contain mock data that conflicts with real database operations and creates inconsistent user experiences.
Success Definition: Zero mock data anywhere in codebase with all components consuming authentic Supabase database records.
Mock Data Identification and Removal
Component-Level Mock Data Elimination
Frontend Components: Audit all React components for hardcoded mock data arrays, objects, or static content that should be dynamically loaded from database.
API Route Handlers: Remove all mock data responses from API endpoints ensuring all routes return real database queries.
Dashboard Widgets: Eliminate mock statistics, fake user data, or placeholder content from all dashboard displays.
Form Pre-population: Remove mock data used for form testing and replace with real user profile data from authenticated sessions.
Authentication and User Data
User Profile Mock Data: Remove all fake user profiles, mock customer information, or placeholder user data from components.
Session Management: Eliminate mock authentication states or fake user sessions that bypass real Supabase authentication.
Role-Based Access: Remove mock admin roles or fake permissions not tied to real user database records.
User Statistics: Replace mock booking counts, spending totals, or activity metrics with real database calculations.
Booking and Business Data
Booking History Mock Data: Remove all fake booking records, mock service history, or placeholder booking information.
Vehicle Information: Eliminate mock vehicle data, fake registration details, or placeholder vehicle profiles.

Analytics and Reporting: Remove mock business intelligence data, fake revenue reports, or placeholder performance metrics.
System Configuration: Eliminate mock settings, fake business rules, or placeholder configuration data.
Real Data Integration Requirements
Supabase Database Connection
Exclusive Database Usage: Ensure all data requests use authenticated Supabase connections with proper Row Level Security.
Real-Time Data Synchronization: Replace mock data with live database subscriptions for dynamic content updates.
Authenticated Data Access: Verify all user-specific data requests use authenticated user sessions for proper data isolation.
Database Query Optimization: Ensure all real data queries are optimized for performance and scalability.
API Endpoint Real Data Integration
Database-First Responses: All API endpoints must return real database query results without mock data fallbacks.
Authentication Integration: Ensure all API routes validate user authentication and return user-specific real data.
Error Handling: Replace mock error responses with real database error handling and user-friendly messages.
Data Validation: Implement real data validation based on actual database constraints and business rules.
Testing and Development Data Strategy
Development Environment Data
Real Test Accounts: Use real Supabase user accounts for development testing instead of mock user profiles.
Authentic Booking Data: Create real bookings through platform interface for testing rather than using mock booking arrays.
Real Vehicle Profiles: Use actual vehicle data created through platform interface for testing and development.
