ðŸ“‹ Phase-by-Phase Development Plan
Phase 1: Authentication Foundation
Backend First:

User registration/login stored procedures
Role-based access (customer/admin)
Session management and security
Password reset workflows
User profile management procedures

Frontend Immediately After:

Login/register forms
Protected route middleware
User context/state management
Basic dashboard shells (customer/admin)
Profile management UI

Test & Validate: Complete auth flow works end-to-end before moving on
Phase 2: Customer Profiles & Vehicle Management
Backend:

Customer profile CRUD procedures
Vehicle registration and classification
Vehicle photo upload handling
Size detection and pricing assignment

Frontend:

Customer profile pages
Vehicle management interface
Photo upload components
Profile editing forms

Test & Validate: Customers can manage their complete profiles
Phase 3: Core Booking Logic
Backend:

Service catalog procedures
Availability checking logic
Booking creation and validation
Slot management procedures

Frontend:

Service selection interface
Calendar/slot picker components
Booking forms
Confirmation pages

Test & Validate: Complete booking flow functional
Phase 4: Pricing & Payments
Backend:

Dynamic pricing calculation procedures
Payment processing integration
Invoice generation
Refund handling

Frontend:

Pricing calculator components
Payment forms
Order confirmation
Receipt/invoice displays

Phase 5: Admin Panel
Backend:

Admin service management procedures
Schedule configuration procedures
Booking modification procedures
Analytics and reporting procedures

Frontend:

Admin dashboard
Service management interface
Schedule management tools
Booking management interface


ðŸ”„ Development Rhythm for Each Phase
1. Design Backend Procedures (Day 1-2)

Define the stored procedures for the phase
Create database functions and validation
Test procedures directly in database

2. Build API Layer (Day 3)

Create thin API wrappers around procedures
Add request/response validation
Test APIs with Postman/tools

3. Build Frontend Components (Day 4-5)

Create UI components that consume APIs
Add form validation and error handling
Implement loading states and UX

4. Integration Testing (Day 6)

Test complete user flows
Fix any backend/frontend mismatches
Optimize performance and UX

5. Validation & Refinement (Day 7)

User testing of the complete flow
Refine based on feedback
Ensure data integrity


ðŸŽ¯ Starting Point: Authentication Phase
Week 1 Focus: Get Authentication Rock Solid
Backend Tasks:

User registration procedure with proper validation
Login procedure with secure session handling
Role assignment (customer/admin)
Password reset with email integration
User profile management procedures

Frontend Tasks:

Clean login/register forms
Protected route system
User state management (context/store)
Basic customer and admin dashboard shells
Profile editing interface

Success Criteria:

Users can register, login, logout seamlessly
Role-based access controls work
Profile management is functional
No authentication bugs or security issues


ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture for Each Phase
Backend Pattern:
Database Procedures â†’ API Services â†’ API Routes
Frontend Pattern:
API Calls â†’ Custom Hooks â†’ React Components â†’ Pages
Testing Pattern:
Database Testing â†’ API Testing â†’ Component Testing â†’ E2E Testing

ðŸ’¡ Benefits of This Approach
For You:

âœ… See progress immediately
âœ… Catch issues early
âœ… Build confidence with working features
âœ… Easier debugging with smaller pieces
âœ… Better API design from frontend feedback

For Client:

âœ… Can see/test features as they're built
âœ… Provide feedback during development
âœ… More confidence in progress
âœ… Earlier UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

For Maintenance:

âœ… Well-tested integration from day one
âœ… Clean separation between backend/frontend
âœ… Easier to add features later
âœ… Reduced technical debt


ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendation
Start with Authentication this week:

Build rock-solid auth backend procedures
Create clean auth frontend interface
Get user registration, login, profiles working perfectly
Move to next phase only when auth is bulletproof

This parallel approach will give you a much stronger foundation and faster development cycle. You'll catch integration issues immediately rather than having a big scary integration phase at the end.
