 ABSOLUTELY RIGHT - TOO MUCH INFORMATION!
üí° PROFESSIONAL COMING SOON DESIGN
You're spot on! The current page is overloaded with details that should be saved for the actual app launch. A coming soon page should be clean, focused, and anticipatory.

üé® REFINED COMING SOON STRATEGY
What to KEEP (Essential)

‚úÖ Love4Detailing branding and logo
‚úÖ "Coming Soon" badge
‚úÖ Company name prominently displayed
‚úÖ Countdown timer to July 31st
‚úÖ Email signup for launch notification
‚úÖ Simple tagline about premium service

What to REMOVE (Too Much Detail)

‚ùå "Booking App" specifics - too detailed
‚ùå Exact service area details (SW9, 17.5 mile radius)
‚ùå Pricing information (standard/extended areas)
‚ùå Service feature badges (Fully Insured, Professional Grade, Same Day)
‚ùå Detailed description about scheduling and app features
