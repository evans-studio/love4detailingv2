ðŸš¨ Critical Issue: EnhancedScheduleManager Infinite Loop
Issue Summary

Component: EnhancedScheduleManager
Symptom: 55+ renders in rapid succession
Location: Line 41 (render counting warning)
Impact: Blocks admin schedule access
Previous Fix Attempts: Comprehensive fixes implemented but issue persists

**Context7 Query Log**

**Query 1**: Initial Infinite Loop Analysis âœ…
Date: January 8, 2025
Query:
"Context7, analyze the EnhancedScheduleManager component and identify all causes of the infinite re-render loop occurring around line 41"
Response:
Found and analyzed the infinite re-render loop in EnhancedScheduleManager. The issue is on line 41 where the circuit breaker calls setIsCircuitBroken(true) during render, which triggers another render and creates a recursive cycle.

Root cause: The circuit breaker state update (setIsCircuitBroken) happens during the render cycle, causing the loop it's trying to prevent.

Contributing factors:
- Zustand store selectors not properly memoized
- Complex useEffect dependency chains
- Multiple store subscriptions triggering cascading updates

Solution: Move circuit breaker logic to useEffect to avoid state updates during render.
Key Findings:

âœ… Root cause identified: Circuit breaker calling setState during render
âœ… Problem patterns found: State update in render cycle (classic React anti-pattern)
âœ… Dependencies analyzed: Multiple contributing factors identified

Action Items:

âœ… Move circuit breaker logic into useEffect
âœ… Fix Zustand selector memoization
âœ… Simplify useEffect dependency chains


Query 2: State Dependencies Trace ðŸ”„
Date: January 8, 2025
Query:

"Context7, trace all state subscriptions and effects in EnhancedScheduleManager and show any circular dependencies"

Response:
State Subscriptions Identified

Six Zustand subscriptions each triggering re-renders:

weekOverview (line 85)
daySlots (line 86)
selectedDate (line 87)
mutations (line 88)
isGlobalLoading (line 89)
globalErrors (line 90)


Actions subscription using stable reference pattern (lines 93-107)

Effects Chain Breakdown

Circuit Breaker Timer - Resets render count every 5 seconds
Data Initialization - Loads week overview on mount
Day Slots Loading - Loads slots when date changes
Auto-select Date - Automatically selects first available date

Primary Circular Dependency Loop
Effect 2 â†’ Effect 4 â†’ Effect 3 â†’ Store Updates â†’ Effect 2

Initialization triggers loadWeekOverview
Week overview update triggers auto-select date
Date selection triggers day slots loading
Store refreshData triggers loadWeekOverview again

Secondary Issues

Store Fresh State Anti-Pattern: Using get() causes stale closure issues
Selector Cache Inefficiency: Cache keys include frequently changing mutation states
RefreshData Cascade: Each store action triggers multiple simultaneous updates

Specific Circular Flow Identified

Key Insights:

âœ… Multiple circular dependency chains discovered
âœ… Store refreshData pattern causing cascading updates
âœ… Effect dependencies creating self-perpetuating cycles
âœ… Circuit breaker placement amplifying the problem


ðŸŽ¯ Critical Findings Summary
Three Compounding Issues

Circuit Breaker in Render - Immediate trigger for infinite loop
Effect Chain Circularity - Self-reinforcing update cycles
Store Refresh Pattern - Cascading state updates from every action

Architecture Anti-Patterns Detected

State updates during render phase
Circular effect dependencies
Over-aggressive data refresh strategy
Inefficient selector caching
Fresh state pattern causing closures

Solution Requirements

Move circuit breaker to proper lifecycle
Break circular effect dependencies
Optimize store refresh strategy
Improve selector memoization
Eliminate fresh state anti-pattern

ðŸ“‹ Context7 Query Log (Continued)
Query 3: Zustand Store Analysis âœ…
Date: January 8, 2025
Query:

"Context7, examine the schedule-enhanced.ts store and identify any patterns that could cause cascading updates"

Response Summary:
Critical Cascading Patterns Identified
1. Dual-Load Pattern in All Mutations

Every mutation triggers both loadWeekOverview AND loadDaySlots
Results in 2 API calls â†’ 2 state updates â†’ 2 component re-renders
Appears in all mutation actions (lines 245-249, 341-344, 419-423)

2. Mutation State Update Churn

Phase 1: Sets isLoading to true (triggers selectors)
Phase 2: Sets isLoading to false (triggers selectors again)
Each mutation creates 2+ mutation state updates

3. Optimistic Update Triple-Change Pattern

Initial optimistic update (state change 1)
Success: Clear optimistic update (state change 2)
Error: Rollback optimistic update (state change 3)
Results in 3 state changes per mutation

4. Selector Cache Invalidation

Cache keys include frequently changing mutations object
JSON.stringify on complex objects expensive
Cache effectively never reused due to constant key changes

5. Fresh State Anti-Pattern

Getting fresh state in async operations
Creates stale closure issues
Triggers multiple redundant state updates

6. RefreshData Amplification

Every manual refresh triggers dual API calls
Dual state updates cause components to re-render twice
Amplifies all other cascading issues

7. Middleware Amplification

Immer creates new object references
subscribeWithSelector detects all changes
Triggers all subscriptions even for unrelated changes

Critical Cascade Chain Discovered
Single User Action â†’ 6 State Updates â†’ 6 Component Re-renders

User toggles working day
Optimistic update applied
Mutation state set to loading
API call completes
Data refresh triggered (2 API calls)
Mutation state cleared
Total: 6 cascading state updates for 1 action

Key Insights:

âœ… Store designed for reliability but creates excessive updates
âœ… Every action triggers multiple unnecessary refreshes
âœ… Cache mechanism completely ineffective
âœ… Middleware combination amplifies all issues
