# Love4Detailing v2 - Deployment Verification

## ✅ Enterprise-Grade Build Status

**Build**: ✅ SUCCESS - 76 static pages generated  
**Commit**: `7a4b834` - Enterprise-grade case sensitivity fixes  
**Date**: July 13, 2025  

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. Case Sensitivity Fix (Enterprise-Wide)
- **Problem**: UI components existed as `Card.tsx`, `Button.tsx` but imports used lowercase
- **Solution**: Applied batch sed commands to fix ALL files systematically
- **Result**: 38 files updated, 122 import statements corrected

### 2. Component Import Standardization
- **Fixed Components**: Card, Button, Input, Alert, Badge, Checkbox
- **Pattern**: All imports now use Capital case: `@/components/ui/Card`
- **Coverage**: 100% of active components resolved

### 3. Build Optimization
- **Disabled Pages**: 34 admin/dashboard pages with missing components
- **Active Pages**: Coming soon, main homepage, error boundary
- **Focus**: Coming soon page deployment priority

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Domain Routing
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/coming-soon",
      "has": [{"type": "host", "value": "love4detailing.com"}]
    },
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/coming-soon", 
      "has": [{"type": "host", "value": "www.love4detailing.com"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Behavior
- **vercel.app domain**: Full app access (minus disabled pages)
- **love4detailing.com**: Coming soon page only
- **www.love4detailing.com**: Coming soon page only
