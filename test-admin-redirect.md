# Admin Redirect Fix Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
Admin users were being redirected to `/dashboard` instead of `/admin` after login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated LoginForm Component
- **File**: `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded redirect to `/dashboard`
- **New Logic**: Redirects to `/auth/callback` to let middleware handle role-based routing

### 2. Updated Auth Callback Route
- **File**: `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- **Change**: Changed default redirect from `/dashboard` to `/`
- **New Logic**: Lets middleware handle role-based routing from root

### 3. Enhanced Middleware
- **File**: `middleware.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added root page redirect for authenticated users
  - Enhanced customer dashboard route protection
  - Admin users accessing `/dashboard` now redirect to `/admin`

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Admin Login
1. Go to `/auth/login`
2. Sign in with admin credentials
3. Should redirect to `/admin` (not `/dashboard`)

### Test 2: Admin Accessing Customer Dashboard
1. While logged in as admin, navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Should automatically redirect to `/admin`

### Test 3: Customer Login
1. Go to `/auth/login`
2. Sign in with customer credentials
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard`

### Test 4: Root Page Access
1. While logged in as admin, go to `/`
2. Should redirect to `/admin`
3. While logged in as customer, go to `/`
4. Should redirect to `/dashboard`

## Expected Behavior
- **Admin users**: Always land on `/admin` after login
- **Customer users**: Always land on `/dashboard` after login
- **Anonymous users**: Can view homepage normally
- **Cross-access protection**: Admins can't access customer dashboard, customers can't access admin

## User Experience Improvement
- No more manual navigation needed for admin users
- Automatic role-based routing
- Consistent redirect behavior across all entry points
