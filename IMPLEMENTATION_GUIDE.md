# Love4Detailing Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

Love4Detailing is a premium mobile car detailing booking system built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Supabase. This document outlines our systematic database-first approach and implementation strategy for building a white-label, licensed system for service businesses.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Database-First Design
- **Single Source of Truth**: All business logic, pricing, and configuration stored in database
- **Scalable Schema**: Designed to handle multiple service types, complex pricing, and business growth
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Comprehensive security model for multi-tenant capability
- **Migration-Based Changes**: All schema changes versioned and trackable

### 2. White-Label Ready
- **Configurable Everything**: Business details, pricing, services all database-driven
- **Clean, Professional UI**: Suitable for premium businesses
- **Branded Experience**: Consistent Love4Detailing purple theme (#9747FF)
- **Licensed System**: Built for replication across multiple businesses

### 3. Robust Fallback Systems
- **Fail-Safe Operations**: System continues functioning even with database issues
- **Consistent User Experience**: Fallback pricing matches database structure exactly
- **Professional Error Handling**: No user-facing errors, graceful degradation

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables Structure

```sql
-- Core business entities
services (id, code, name, description, base_duration_minutes)
service_pricing (service_id, vehicle_size, price_pence, duration_minutes)
vehicle_sizes (size, display_name, description)
vehicle_model_registry (make, model, default_size, verified)

-- User and authentication
users (id, email, full_name, phone, role, is_active)
customer_rewards (user_id, total_points, current_tier)

-- Booking system
available_slots (id, slot_date, start_time, end_time, max_bookings, current_bookings)
bookings (id, user_id, service_id, slot_id, vehicle_id, status, total_price_pence)
vehicles (id, user_id, make, model, year, registration, size, color)

-- Schedule management
schedule_templates (id, name, is_active, business_hours)
schedule_slots (template_id, day_of_week, start_time, duration_minutes)

-- Configuration
system_config (key, value, description)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: For security and distributed system compatibility
2. **Enum Types**: For vehicle_size, booking_status, user_role consistency
3. **Price Storage**: All prices in pence (integer) to avoid floating point issues
4. **Audit Trail**: created_at, updated_at on all tables with automatic triggers
5. **Flexible Scheduling**: Template-based system for different business hours
